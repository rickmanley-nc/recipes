![pic](../../docs/assets/images/**.png)

### Ingredients
#### Salad
* 30–40 brussels sprouts (makes about 4 cups shredded)
* 6 slices bacon
* 1 cup pomegranate arils
* 1/3 cup almonds
* 1/2 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese

#### Dressing
* 1 shallot, chopped
* juice of one orange
* juice of one lemon
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 tablespoon honey
* 2 tablespoons Greek yogurt
* 1/3 cup oil
* up to 2 tablespoons water

### Steps
1. Fry the bacon over low heat until crispy. Drain on paper towels; crumble and set aside.
2. Shred or slice the brussels sprouts. I’ve found the absolute best way to do this is with a handy dandy mandoline – slice them super thin and then break the layers apart with your hands. Fluff it up a little and you’ll get a delicate shredded texture.
3. Prep the pomegranate seeds. Place the almonds in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Toss the brussels sprouts, bacon crumbles, pomegranate arils, almonds, and cheese together.
4. Place all the dressing ingredients in a food processor and pulse until creamy. Add the water as needed for consistency. Toss the salad with the dressing and serve immediately.
